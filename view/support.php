If you know PHP, HTML, CSS or JS and you want to develop new features or fix/improve something that should be fixed/improved thank you. I usually work alone because I never had the chance to work in a project with other people, but I really enjoy teamworking.<br>If you are a somewhat SEO expert and you would like to give me some advice I would appreciate it! I feel that this is my weakest spot in my web skills.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0 mt-1 d-block" style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">If you would like to share this project with a friend that might be interested it would be marvellous. The core principle in this project is to provide a free non-tracking website to start learning proactively. As you can see in the page <a href="/data-management" class="myred-text whitelist">Data management</a> there is minimal-to-none data collection. Again the goal is just to have a good (and I hope useful) online service for free.  </p>
                    <h5 class="se d-inline-block mygrey-text mt-4">Propose yourself as a moderator</h5>
                    <p class="mb-0 mt-1 d-block" style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Everyone knows that offering an online services in which people can post freely could be very dangerous. Websites are one of the main way malicious people use to spread fake news or ever worse malware/viruses. This is why if you would like to contribute and propose yourself as a moderator you can really make the difference. Unluckily I am a working student so money is very tight but I can pay with my ever ending gratitude for this position.<br>

                    <p class="mb-0 mt-1 d-block" style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Web Hosting can be expensive, I started with a basic Linux Hosting to better cope with the initial cost. I would like to remind you that this website is free and you will never see annoying ads. The <i>"business model"</i> of this platform is configured as <b>Donationware</b> so it relies on user donation to sustain itself. I sincerely hope to be able to keep this project as it is but I might not be able to in the future. So if you want to give even a small donation I sincerely appreciate this and the whole comunity should too.<br>If this is the case you can buy me a coffe via PayPal at
